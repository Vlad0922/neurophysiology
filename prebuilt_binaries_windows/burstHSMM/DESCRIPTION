Title: Burst detection through hidden semi-Markov model
Author: Surya T Tokdar <st118@stat.duke.edu>
Maintainer: Surya T Tokdar <st118@stat.duke.edu>
Description: This package allows to analyze spike trains for burst detection. Burst and non-burst states are modeled as a switching gamma process, within which the inter-spike intervals (ISI) are distributed according to two different gamma distributions. The hidden burst/non-burst states as well as the parameters of all gamma distributions are estimated through a MCMC within Bayesian setting. See Tokdar et al. (2009) for more details.
